# User Instructions
#
# Define a function smooth that takes a path as its input
# (with optional parameters for weight_data, weight_smooth,
# and tolerance) and returns a smooth path. The first and 
# last points should remain unchanged.
#
# Smoothing should be implemented by iteratively updating
# each entry in newpath until some desired level of accuracy
# is reached. The update should be done according to the
# gradient descent equations given in the instructor's note
# below (the equations given in the video are not quite 
# correct).
